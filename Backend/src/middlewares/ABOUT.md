Middleware functions in frameworks like Express.js are invoked in the order they are registered, and they execute between the receipt of the incoming request and the sending of the corresponding response.

Here's a breakdown of how middleware functions work in the request-response cycle:

    Incoming Request: When a request is received by the server, it passes through the middleware stack before reaching the route handler or final destination.

    Middleware Execution: Each middleware function in the stack has the opportunity to inspect and potentially modify the incoming request, perform operations, or terminate the request-response cycle prematurely.

    Next Middleware or Route Handler: After a middleware function completes its operations, it can choose to pass control to the next middleware in the stack by invoking the next() function, or it can end the request-response cycle by sending a response back to the client.

    Response Generation: Once the request has passed through all the middleware functions and reached the route handler, the route handler executes to generate the final response. Middleware functions can also intercept and modify the response generated by the route handler before it is sent back to the client.

By inserting middleware functions into the request-response cycle, developers can perform various tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, error handling, request parsing, and response formatting. This modular approach allows for better organization, reusability, and separation of concerns in web applications.
